# **Fast Fourier Transform based Convolution Neural Networks**
Hello, this is Rushikesh, Shaurya and Sheenu's project for Deep learning systems. In this project, we add autodiff support for 1D and 2D Fast Fourier Transform and Inverse Fast Fourier Transform. We test our implementation with custom test cases and further show the application of these operations in a CNN.
